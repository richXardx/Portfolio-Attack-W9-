The entire attack was done in a virtual machine. We used Oracle VM Virtal Box for this. WIN2022, KALI LINUX and MS2 metasploitable was used for this. This is based on the learning outcome of Week 8 and pre-requisites. Some additional files are present that will be relevant. The Script uses some resources owned my PSI Squared and to Invoke attacks in the victim OS, we used files provided by the repository of Red Cranary.
